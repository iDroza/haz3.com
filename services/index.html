            <h3>Hazardous Waste Transportation</h3>
            <p>
              Coordinated transportation for RCRA hazardous and non-hazardous industrial wastes, routed to appropriately permitted treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs).
            </p>
            <p>
              We handle drum, tote, and bulk movements for manufacturing, laboratories, public agencies, utilities, construction projects, and other generators across Northern California.
            </p>
            <p class="sidebar-note">
              Outcome: containers and bulk volumes off-site with a clear record of where they went and when.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Drum &amp; Container Management</h3>
            <p>
              Routine and project-based removal of 5-gallon pails, drums, and totes from accumulation areas, production lines, and satellite locations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Services can be structured as recurring routes or on-call pickups, depending on your generation rate and storage constraints.
            </p>
            <p class="sidebar-note">
              Typical streams: solvents, oils, paint waste, treatment sludges, off-spec product, contaminated absorbents.

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Bulk Liquid &amp; Solid Waste Hauling</h3>
            <p>
              Coordination of bulk tank, pit, and lagoon removals, as well as high-volume solid waste streams that are more efficient to move in bulk rather than drums.
            </p>
            <p>
              The emphasis is on selecting the right equipment, routing, and facility for the specific waste characteristics and site access.
            </p>
            <p class="sidebar-note">
              Useful for tank cleanouts, production changeovers, and project-level remediation work.

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Lab Packs &amp; Small Containers</h3>
            <p>
              Consolidation, packing, and transportation of small containers from laboratories, R&amp;D facilities, educational labs, and testing environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              We work from inventory lists or on-site walkthroughs to organize compatible materials into compliant lab packs for shipment.
            </p>
            <p class="sidebar-note">
              Typical environments: R&amp;D labs, QC labs, school chemistry labs, technical training facilities.

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Universal Waste &amp; E-Waste</h3>
            <p>
              Collection and routing of universal waste streams and related electronics, coordinated in line with hazardous waste shipments or as stand-alone projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              This can include lamps, batteries, certain electronics, and similar regulated streams that require documented downstream management.
            </p>
            <p class="sidebar-note">
              Helpful for facility cleanouts, remodels, and ongoing maintenance operations.

            </p>
            <p>
              We do not replace your EHS or legal advisors; instead, we make sure the operational side of the work is aligned with the paperwork.

            <h3>Initial Review</h3>
            <p>
              You share your facility location, waste types, approximate quantities, and timing. We identify whether the project fits our footprint and what additional information, if any, is needed.

            <p>
              Existing profiles, SDS, or manifests are reviewed. Where needed, we coordinate profiling with the receiving facility so acceptance is clear before the truck is dispatched.

              Pickups are scheduled around your production, outage, or access windows. We address site-specific details such as gates, docks, school or patient traffic, and equipment needs.

            <p class="section-subtitle">
              Most generators fall into one of two patterns: recurring waste that needs predictable pickups, or larger one-time projects tied to maintenance or changeovers.

            <h3>Routine Drum &amp; Container Service</h3>
            <p>
              For facilities generating a steady volume of drums, totes, or small containers, we can establish a recurring pickup cadence—monthly, quarterly, or as dictated by your accumulation limits and storage space.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal is to make hazardous waste shipments a normal part of your operations calendar, not a last-minute scramble when storage areas are full.

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Project-Driven Removals</h3>
            <p>
              For turnarounds, tank cleanouts, facility cleanouts, or one-time remediation work, we treat the movement as a defined project with clear start and end points.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scheduling, containerization, and disposal routing are built around the project timeline so you can close out work orders and move on.
